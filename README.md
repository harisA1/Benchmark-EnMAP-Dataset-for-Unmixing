# Bare Soil Detection Benchmark from EnMAP Imagery

This repository provides a benchmark dataset for evaluating bare soil detection methods on EnMAP hyperspectral imagery. The dataset includes preprocessed spectral data and corresponding ground truth class labels derived from Sentinel-2 and land cover products.

## üîç Dataset Description

The dataset consists of:

- `image`: Flat EnMAP hyperspectral image with shape `(N, B)`  
  where `N = height √ó width`, `B = 244 spectral bands` (covering 420‚Äì2450 nm)
- `ground_truth`: Flat array of class labels with shape `(N,3)`  
  Ground truth is a categorical mask with the following classes:
  - `0`: Soil-dominant pixel  
  - `1`: Vegetation-dominant pixel  
  - `2`: Other (urban, forest, water, etc.)
- `height`, `width`: Original spatial dimensions of the EnMAP scene (350 √ó 400)

The scene covers an agricultural region near **Lake Zazari in Western Macedonia, Greece**, and was acquired in **October 2023**.

Example: Load the Data in Python
--------------------------------
import numpy as np

data = np.load("benchmark_dataset.npz")
X = data["image"]            # shape (N, 244)
y = data["ground_truth"]     # shape (N,)
H = int(data["height"])
W = int(data["width"])

# Optional reshape
X_image = X.reshape(H, W, -1)
y_image = y.reshape(H, W)
